    <p>Welcome to my informational website about my favourite album ever published, Porter Robinson's "Nurture."</p>
    <p>I first encountered the very first song "Get Your Wish", in the 2021 stay-at-home online edition of Porter's yearly festival, "Second Sky" (titled "Secret Sky" during COVID.)</p>
    <p>I instantly fell in love. The melodies, the mastering, the vocals, everything about it just felt so... comforting, somehow.</p>
    <p>As more of the tracks released, such as "Look at the Sky" at the end of the live set, the album quickly made its way into my heart.</p>
    <p>Ever since, I have not stopped listening to the album, remixes of it, or his live sets.</p>
    <p>I always had a liking for Porter's music, such as his debut album "Worlds", where tracks like "Flicker" or "Hear the Bells" jumped out to me.</p>
    <p>But Nurture? It's something special.</p>

  lifelike: |
    “Lifelike” is the instrumental opening track of Porter Robinson’s sophomore album, Nurture.
    Clocking in at just over ninety seconds, the song serves as a tone-setter for the rest of the project.
    It opens with soft beeps, birds chirping, and a mellow instrumental motif, which is slowly built upon with strings, percussion, vocal snippets, and more.
    It perfectly sets the mood for the nature-inspired, melodic, and beautiful Nurture.<br />
    This track and “Wind Tempos” were both cited by Porter as having been heavily influenced by the music of Masakatsu Takagi.

  look-at-the-sky: |
    An upbeat hopeful song, “Look At The Sky” is the fourth single the album.
    The song debuted on May 9th, 2020 during his set at Secret Sky as the final song of the set.
    It was later officially released on January 27, 2021.<br />
    The song follows the journey of a person dealing with (creative) burnout and imposter syndrome, and their path out of it.

  get-your-wish: |
    “Get Your Wish” is the lead single from Nurture. It marks Porter's first original song release as a solo artist since his 2014 debut album "Worlds" and his 2016 collaboration track with Madeon, "Shelter."<br />
    The song is about finding a reason to move forward, even if it’s not for your own sake, and Porter’s breakthrough after several years of failing to write music and being crushed.

  wind-tempos: |
    “Wind Tempos” is the longest and one of the most relatively experimental songs on Nurture.
    Built around a one-note piano melody. the song slowly builds, glitching and pulsating for its first three minutes.
    However, the song transforms fully in its second half, a beautiful one-minute piano solo giving way to a glitchy, repeating sample that the second half is centered around.

  musician: |
    “Musician” is the fifth single from Porter Robinson’s sophomore album Nurture.<br />
    The song depicts the internal struggle Porter felt following the release of his debut LP Worlds and how he eventually fought through worries that music was not the right path for his future.<br /><br />

    A set of vocal chops are built from an unreleased collaboration between Porter and electropop trio Kero Kero Bonito.<br /><br />

    When a Stereogum article from January 27, 2021 leaked abbreviations of most unreleased Nurture track titles, “Musician” was notably the only one whose entire title was posted. (The leak has since been taken down.)

  do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do: |
    The day Nurture was released, Porter wrote on Twitter:<br /><br />

    "I wrote this song after listening to this artist Cornelius for the first time. It was one of those situations where people had told me over and over again how much I was going to love him, but it almost got overwhelming, so I sort of avoided it. Then I finally listened, and wrote this song in eight hours. It feels like rollerblading through my neighbourhood—just feeling free and in this childlike state."

  mother: |
    The song Mother aims to express the love that Porter feels for his parents—as well as the grief of growing up.<br />
    Porter says: "I felt like the minute I moved out, my youth would be over and I’d hardly ever see my family or dog again."<br />
    In reality it wasn’t like that at all, he still sees them all the time.
    But his aim was to capture the sad side of growing up—of realising your parents aren’t infallible.

  dullscythe: |
    "dullscythe" is by far the most abstract and experimental song on the album, and it’s the one track that doesn’t have a standard tempo.<br />
    The aim was for it to feel really hard and chaotic—something at the midway point to keep people on their toes—and it makes you feel like you're getting smacked around in a thousand directions.

  sweet-time: |
    "Sweet Time" is about being so in love with someone that, for the first time in your life, you’re scared of dying.
    You realise you aren’t guaranteed an eternity together.<br />
    In the lyrics, Porter talks about going to find God to make sure she’s okay, and it makes me cry every time.<br />
    I was bawling my eyes out when I first heard the track, I could barely attempt to sing along.<br /><br />

    In the end, though, it’s also an expression of gratitude, because the world is lucky to have her.
    Rika and Porter have been together four years, recently he even proposed to her!

  mirror: |
    An upbeat, melodic song, “Mirror” is the third single released from Porter Robinson’s 2021 album, Nurture. It was announced the day before its release on Instagram along with a picture of a mirror.<br />
    The exact time was revealed just an hour before its release, and a snippet of the song played in the album’s teaser trailer.<br /><br />

    The song goes back and forth between two voices, Porter Robinson and the narrator. Porter expresses disappointment and criticism, while the narrator gives encouragement and hope.<br /><br />

    Overall, the song is about Porter pushing back on his self-doubt.<br />
    He talked about his inner criticism in a YouTube description:<br />
    "“Mirror” is a song about the costs of being hard on yourself... It can be really liberating to recognize that most of the time, we’re only letting our own thoughts get in the way, and we can do something about it."

  something-comforting: |
    First announced on March 9, 2020, by Porter on Twitter, “Something Comforting” is the second promotional single for Robinson’s second studio album Nurture.<br />
    Emotionally and lyrically, this song captures the essence of the album. It was the first thing written that became the seed for everything that followed.

  blossom: |
    “Blossom,” a love ballad, is the 12th song on Nurture.<br />
    It stands out in the tracklist as it’s simpler instrumentally compared to the more complex electronics of the album, comprised solely of a guitar instrumental (stated by Porter to be a keyboard emulating a guitar) and the Porter's pitch-shifted voice.<br /><br />

    Porter said in a Reddit AMA that it’s “one of the best songs [he’s] ever written,” penning it in just one night.<br /><br />

    The song’s title is “Blossom” as it was written for Porter's girlfriend Rika, whose name translates to “pear blossom” in Japanese.

  unfold: |
    Coming out the day before Nurture’s release, "Unfold" is the sixth and final single for the album.<br />
    The song was officially revealed along with the rest of the Nurture non-singles on April 12, 2021.<br />
    However, fans had discovered its title and references to it being a collab with Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs in the code of the "nurtu.re" website in August the previous year.<br /><br />

    In its original state, "Unfold" was meant to be a track very early on in the tracklist. However, as Porter kept working on it, he realised it was an end-of-album moment. "If I’m going to have this epic wall-of-sound thing, it needs to come towards the end."

  trying-to-feel-alive: |
    "Trying to Feel Alive", the closing track to Nurture, I have nothing to say about.<br />
    It's such a sublime piece, with so much emotion and energy, I think it's better to let Porter himself explain.<br /><br />

    "This song was me trying to make sense of the whole journey, trying to figure out what has changed. What did I learn? Am I any better? Am I satisfied? It was enormously difficult to write, but ultimately, the answer I came to is that satisfaction isn’t the real goal. If you accomplish everything you’re striving for, you’ll stop looking forward. There’s nowhere to go. This is another one where I was crying while writing it because I guess it was sort of a personal epiphany. Here I am on the other side of this, still struggling with making music, still not necessarily feeling whole, but beginning to understand that maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe that’s the point. Maybe making music is my way of trying to feel alive, over and over again."
