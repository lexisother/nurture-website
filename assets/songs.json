It perfectly sets the mood for the nature-inspired, melodic, and beautiful Nurture.\nThis track and “Wind Tempos” were both cited by Porter as having been heavily influenced by the music of Masakatsu Takagi.","preview_url":"https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/6197cd31c8fa22a2a1d28ea71577df6187798a25?cid=774b29d4f13844c495f206cafdad9c86","track_number":1,"type":"track","uri":"spotify:track:70gDh9HAjzlRjEyrlR3y9d"},{"artists":[{"external_urls":{"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam"},"href":"https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam","id":"3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam","name":"Porter Robinson","type":"artist","uri":"spotify:artist:3dz0NnIZhtKKeXZxLOxCam"}],"available_markets":["AD","AE","AG","AL","AM","AO","AR","AT","AU","AZ","BA","BB","BD","BE","BF","BG","BH","BI","BJ","BN","BO","BR","BS","BT","BW","BY","BZ","CA","CD","CG","CH","CI","CL","CM","CO","CR","CV","CW","CY","CZ","DE","DJ","DK","DM","DO","DZ","EC","EE","EG","ES","FI","FJ","FM","FR","GA","GB","GD","GE","GH","GM","GN","GQ","GR","GT","GW","GY","HK","HN","HR","HT","HU","ID","IE","IL","IN","IQ","IS","IT","JM","JO","KE","KG","KH","KI","KM","KN","KR","KW","KZ","LA","LB","LC","LI","LK","LR","LS","LT","LU","LV","LY","MA","MC","MD","ME","MG","MH","MK","ML","MN","MO","MR","MT","MU","MV","MW","MX","MY","MZ","NA","NE","NG","NI","NL","NO","NP","NR","NZ","OM","PA","PE","PG","PH","PK","PL","PS","PT","PW","PY","QA","RO","RS","RU","RW","SA","SB","SC","SE","SG","SI","SK","SL","SM","SN","SR","ST","SV","SZ","TD","TG","TH","TJ","TL","TN","TO","TR","TT","TV","TW","TZ","UA","UG","US","UY","UZ","VC","VE","VN","VU","WS","XK","ZA","ZM","ZW"],"disc_number":1,"duration_ms":309985,"explicit":false,"external_urls":{"spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5lXNcc8QeM9KpAWNHAL0iS"},"href":"https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5lXNcc8QeM9KpAWNHAL0iS","id":"5lXNcc8QeM9KpAWNHAL0iS","is_local":false,"name":"Look at the Sky","description":"An upbeat hopeful song, “Look At The Sky” is the fourth single the album.

Porter expresses disappointment and criticism, while the narrator gives encouragement and hope.\n\nOverall, the song is about Porter pushing back on his self-doubt.\nHe talked about his inner criticism in a YouTube description:\n\"“Mirror” is a song about the costs of being hard on yourself...
